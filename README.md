# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository provides a streamlined solution for predicting heart disease using machine learning, integrated with an interactive Streamlit web application.

Check out the deployed app: [Heart Disease Prediction](https://heartdiseaseprediction-bvgcuvmrkonftkg7nb8bhg.streamlit.app/)

## Repository Contents

- **`Heart Disease Prediction Model.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the model's development, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- **`new_model.pkl`**: The trained machine learning model saved as a `.pkl` file for deployment.
- **`app1.py`**: A Streamlit application offering a user-friendly interface for heart disease prediction based on input parameters.

## Features

- Interactive web app for real-time predictions.
- Pre-trained machine learning model ready for deployment.
- Lightweight and easy-to-run repository.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git  
   cd heart-disease-prediction  

2. Install the necessary dependencies:  
   Ensure you have Python and Streamlit installed. You can install Streamlit using:
